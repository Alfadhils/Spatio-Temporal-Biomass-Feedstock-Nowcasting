# Optimizing Long-Term Biomass Supply Chains: A Deep Learning and Mixed Integer Linear Programming Approach

## Overview

This repository contains the codebase for the optimization of the Biomass Supply Chain (BSC) system, as presented in the thesis titled "Optimizing the Long-term Biomass Supply Chain: A Deep Learning and Mixed Integer Linear Programming Approach."

## Thesis Abstract

This thesis introduces a comprehensive case study focused on optimizing the long-term Biomass Supply Chain (BSC) system. The proposed methodology consists of two key phases:

1. **Predictive Modeling with Deep Learning:**

   - Development of a predictive model for forecasting biomass availability.
   - Utilization of Deep Learning (DL) techniques to handle the Spatio-Temporal (ST) nature of the data.
2. **Facility Location Problem with MILP:**

   - Formulation of a Facility Location Problem model.
   - Deployment of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to optimize facility location-allocation and minimize costs.

The primary objective is to establish a framework for realizing the BSC system in a given region, leveraging advanced DL and MILP methods. This approach aims to reduce dependence on Geographical Information Systems (GIS), addressing the associated challenges of expertise and high costs.

## Key Features

- **MILP-Based Facility Location Optimization:**

  - Formulation and implementation of a Facility Location Problem model.
  - Utilization of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to optimize facility location-allocation and minimize costs.
- **Reducing Dependence on GIS:**

  - Introduction of a framework that reduces the reliance on Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in BSC optimization.

## Case Study and Literature Review

The thesis begins with an in-depth exploration of biomass as a renewable energy alternative, highlighting its potential and addressing prevalent challenges. The case study and literature review provide a detailed background and context for the optimization efforts.

## Contributions

The contributions of this research extend beyond the specific case study, offering a versatile methodology applicable to other renewable energy systems and industrial processes. The integration of DL with MILP establishes a novel approach for optimizing long-term dynamic systems in the renewable energy sector.
